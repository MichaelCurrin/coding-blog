# Coding Blog
> My blog of experiences and advice around coding, focusing on Python development.

This repo is viewable as a website at [michaelcurrin.github.io/coding-blog/](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/coding-blog/), built with _Jekyll_ and hosted with _Github Pages_.

The site's theme is [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight).

To setup and run this repo locally, follow this instructions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/1085ab164550b31272699920b5549d4b). I hope you'll find that useful so you can setup your own static site for whatever you wish.

## Notes

The [github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem is set in the Gemfile so that `site.github` can be used in templates. The site still builds to Github Pages without it set in the config, but it is added for consistency and in case it is needed for Netlify (running outside of Github).
