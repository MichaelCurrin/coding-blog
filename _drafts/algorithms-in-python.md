title: Algorithms in Python
description: ''

Here I cover some data structures which you might come across on a code challenge website or during a coding interview, or maybe in an application.

I cover the concepts here with how to implement using just the `list` type. The next level would be using some built-in types, or implementing your own such as with a class.

I also relate how to do these based on physical objects, rather than just data which you can't see.

## Queues

Real - restaurant or production line or shipping or orders

Digital - online orders, record of user activity

## Stacks

Plates

Memory - stack overflow and heap vs stack.
