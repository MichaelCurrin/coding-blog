title: Build your own Jekyll blog
description: Overview of content I like to share when coaching

---
## Intro

The content here is focused on build a static website such as a blog, using Jekyll. I want to describe available features and a path of how to build them.

This post is for someone who has at least a bit of coding experience and wants to start coding their own blog or improve their existing blog.

I plan to use this list as a reference when coaching people online - whether in a blog post, a face-to-face online chat or even a live-streaming coding session. I am going to focus on topics and broad strokes here. You'll get more details out of chatting to me directly.

I have a profile on Jekyll Forums - you can message me there directly and I'll be happy to help.
