title: How to livestream on YouTube
description: Stream your webcam or coding session to the world

I am only getting into livestreaming for the time but want to share the steps I learn as I go.

You can setup a live session on Youtube for free. There is just some verification to get through and some optional software depending on what you want to stream.

## Resources

* [Live Streaming & Premieres](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/product-features/live/?gclsrc=aw.ds#youtube-live) under YouTube product features.
* [Create a livestream with an encoder](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en&ref_topic=9257984) on YouTube/Google support.

## Signup for livestreaming

1. Login to YouTube - [youtube.com](https://youtube.com/ "youtube.com").
2. Open YouTube Studio - [studio.youtube.com](https://studio.youtube.com/ "https://studio.youtube.com/").
3. Click _Create_ in the top right.
4. Click _Go live_.
5. You'll have to go through the _Verify_ flow. You'll be prompted for your country and phone number and will get a text message or call to verify that you are not a robot.
6. The dashboard will tell you to wait - _"Ready in 24 hours"_. Come back again and then click _Go live_.


## Install an encoder

You can do this while you wait for the verification step.

If you just need to stream audio and video with your webcam, you'll probably be fine as you are.

But you'll need an encode for the following, according to the support docs.

> * Share your screen or broadcast your gameplay
> * Use external audio and video hardware
> * Manage an advanced production (like multiple cameras and microphones)

For my case, I want to stream a live coding session where I stream my screen maybe eventually use a microphone.

Go to the list of _YouTube Live verified encoders_ on this guide:

- [Create a livestream with an encoder](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en&ref_topic=9257984#zippy=%2Csoftware-encoders)

Find one appropriate for your device and operating system.

I like the idea of the first one on the list, as it works on macOS, Windows and Linux and is free and open source
