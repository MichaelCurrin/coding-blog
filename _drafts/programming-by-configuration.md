title: Programming by configuration
description: A collect of systems which you setup using configs rather than code

---
It is becoming more popular to use systems which use a config to define how your application should run or how the infrastructure (such as a website or monitor) should be setup. This is declarative programming which means you don't have to spend time writing step-by-step code which would probably be more detailed and error-prone.

### Config-based systems

Below is a list of systems I have worked with or read about which use config files, along with what the input is.
