I enjoyed this video on YouTube:

* [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U "The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie")

The speaker asks - is coding art, science, engineering?

He covers Conway's Game of Life - an algorithm transferred from paper to screen which makes intriguing patterns.

He talks about the [Mandelbrot Set](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html) - an area of math dealing with an infinitely repeating pattern which as you zoom it looks similar to itself but never repeats.
