title: The future of websites - headless CMS
description: Repost of an article

I found this article a good read and relevant to my recent research into choosing a CMS.

[scotch.io - The Future of Websites - Headless CMSs](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-future-of-websites-headless-cmss)

And it mentions some specific sites to try out. It's news to me that Wordpress can go headless now - it has an API so you can build your frontend but use their CMS editor.

This article discusses types of CMS such as
- headless 
- decoupled
- hybrid
<br>

For more details of the CMS types, I recommend this article: [coredna.com - Headless vs Decoupled CMS](https://www.coredna.com/blogs/headless-vs-decoupled-cms)

See also this site - [HeadlessCMS.org](https://headlesscms.org/). Use it to search for CMS tools within search parameters.
