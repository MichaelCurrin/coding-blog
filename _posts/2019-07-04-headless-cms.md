title: The future of websites - headless CMS
description: Repost of an article

I found this it a good read and relevant to my recent research into choosing a CMS.

https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-future-of-websites-headless-cmss

The article discusses types of CMS platforms
- headless 
- decoupled
- hybrid

And it mentions some specific sites to try out. It's news to me that Wordpress can go headless now - it has an API so you can build your frontend but use their CMS editor.
