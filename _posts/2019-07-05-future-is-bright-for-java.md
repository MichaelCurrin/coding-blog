title: The future is bright for Java
description: Repost on an article

I read this article [Kotlin And Python Are Fun, But Java Developers Are Semantically Aligned With The Future](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2019/07/01/venkat-subramaniam-kotlin-and-python-are-fun-but-java-developers-are-semantically-aligned--with-the-future/) by Venkat Subramaniam.

The author is an expert in making predictions about languages and he says Java has a bright future. It is adapting to become more relevant - the Switch expression has been improved and the new GraalVM increases performance of Java and similar languages. Java is storng on concurrency and that will be great for cloud programming where non-blocking operations are important. e.g. Loading of assets in your browser while a partially loaded page is displayed.

Java apparently has the most devs in the world he says, though I though it was JavaScript though. Anyway that's research for another day.
