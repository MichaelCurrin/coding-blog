title: Static Site Resources
description: Introduction to my project, which assists  with building static sites
---

I build with Jekyll or Hugo and host on Github Pages or Netlify. There are setup and run instructions I need to follow often and command commands I can reuse across projects. Therefore I've created a project collecting this info in one place, to help myself and others who are developing static sites.
