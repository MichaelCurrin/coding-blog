## Doc site builders

### VuePress

- [Link](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
- Built on VueJS.
- This works well for docs of existing Vue sites.

### Docsify

- [Link](https://docsify.js.org/)
- Built on VueJS.
- Turn your existing *docs* folder into a docs site. I wrote a tutorial for this [here](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-template/#/).

### Docute

- [Link](https://docute.org/)
- > "Docute is basically a JavaScript file that fetches Markdown files and renders them as a single-page application".

### Read The Docs

- [Link](https://readthedocs.org/)
- Built on Sphinx (a Python library).
- Format with *reStructuredText* or *Markdown*.
- Host on the Read the Docs site. This seems a like a common place for libraries to host their documentation, especially if they are Python libraries. Or self-host e.g. on Github Pages.
- Build from `/docs` directory.
- > "Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you."

### GitBook

- [Link](https://www.gitbook.com/)
- Great if you don't want to write any code, but limited on number of public and private sites on the free plan.
