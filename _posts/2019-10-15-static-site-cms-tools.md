## Forestry

[forestry.io](https://forestry.io)

> Write front-end code with Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll or Vuepress and push to your Git repo. Forestry will pull in your commits and update the CMS.
> 
> Invite your team to create content in a rich UI. Their updates get committed back without merge conflicts.


## Jekyl Admin

This unfortunately requires a lot of knowledge about the Jekyll ecosystem of liquid/markdown,  functions, layouts and so on. So you might have to write code in your CMS and edit YAML. But this can still make you more productive as a developer using a CMS rather than an IDE.

## Jekyl Manager

[jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-manager)

A fork of Jekyll Admin that has some extra features.
