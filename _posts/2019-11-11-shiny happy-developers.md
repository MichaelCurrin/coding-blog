Recommendations to make your software developers happy:

1. Use the best gear money can buy
2. Enable deep focus
3. Embrace flexible working hours
4. Itâ€™s a burn-down not a burn-out!
5. Empower
6. Promote Continuous Learning
7. Instil a sense of purpose

Those points come from [Shiny Happy Developers](https://towardsdatascience.com/shiny-happy-developers-7928ddc22878) post on [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/). I encourage you to read more there as I loved the post and can really relate the ideas.

 The post mentions a couple of things you can try as a team leader or manager to improve happiness of devs in your business. If you are a developer, you can seek these out yourself in your current or future positions. Maybe talk to your fellow devs and HR to see how your office environment could be improved.
