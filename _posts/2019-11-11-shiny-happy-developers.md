Here are some recommendations for how to make your software developers happy.

1. **Use the best gear money can buy** - Devs get impatient running on cheap / slow equipment.
2. **Enable deep focus** - Open-plan offices can hinder concentration and getting into a state of flow when solving problems.
3. **Embrace flexible working hours** - Including remote working, flexi-time, telecommuting, compressed work weeks, digital nomad.
4. **It's a burn-down not a burn-out!** - Don't expect devs to regularly work overtime.
5. **Empower** - Autonomy, not micromanagement.
6. **Promote Continuous Learning** - Devs who get bored and lose curiosity could write worse code and eventually leave.
7. **Instill a sense of purpose** - You work makes a difference. Celebrate your successes!

Those points come from [Shiny Happy Developers](https://towardsdatascience.com/shiny-happy-developers-7928ddc22878) post on [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/). I encourage you to read more there as I loved the post and can really relate the ideas.

 The post mentions a couple of things you can try as a team leader or manager to improve happiness of devs in your business. If you are a developer, you can seek these out yourself in your current or future positions. Maybe talk to your fellow devs and HR to see how your office environment could be improved.
