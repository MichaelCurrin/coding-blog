description: Stuck in a right? Find some new challenges. And don't get fixated on always being original.

If you get bored and can't think of anything original to build, try finding a list of code challenges to solve. Some websites will email you a challenge a day or you can see what other solutions people submit.

Asks a friend or colleague about a challenge in their life which could be solved with technology. Maybe there is an existing tool you can find and setup for them, or you can put together the ideas from a few tools you see and make something new. Maybe they just need to change their approach or lifestyle, rather than using a tech tool as a solution to the result rather than cause.

Also, don't get stuck on being creative and original. Everything come from something before. A lot of programming is often just gluing existing tools together. Whether they are different Python libraries, or using a webserver and database service to serve data you scraped. You have a unique background and community. 

Maybe you can take the idea of Instagram but tailor it to dog owners or hikers. Or create a meetup and networking platform for tech people in your city. Or maybe just make a pointless and fun game or script which force you to learn some new skills and maybe you'll use those pieces of code or skills in a later project.

Often the best code is no code - the problem you are trying to be solved has problem being solved in a similar way on a blog post or Stack Overflow and maybe exists as a library or script. You might have to tweak it or take the best parts from it - that's the beauty of open source code.
