- _GraphQL: The Documentary_
    - Watch on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8) or [Honeypot.io](https://videos.honeypot.io/graphql-documentary-2019/)
    - This covers the history of GraphQL starting in Facebook, around 2012 when they had to keep up with a major shift of their audience to mobile. 
    - I'd highly recommend this video for frontend developers as it makes API queries in React and mobile apps much easier. Or anyone looking to build a REST or GraphQL API.
