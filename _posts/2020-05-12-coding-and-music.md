## Music composed by computers

### Mubert

I found this tool which provides AI-generated music based on human-made samples. Their mobile app is great. I just found the genres too limiting based on my tastes but there are plenty to choose from.

### TEDx talk - The world's ugliest music

Watch this _TEDxMIA_ talk on YouTube:

* [The world's ugliest music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RENk9PK06AQ) by Scott Rickard

A song was composed by an algorithm which made sure there are no repeats or patterns in time between the notes or in pitch changes. It's not just random - its deliberately pattern free.

The result is music which is ugly to us. As we look for a pattern but there is none. It reminds me of some jazz music I've heard, but this is way worse.

A pianist performs the piece at the end.
