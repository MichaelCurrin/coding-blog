The point of writing code is so that a computer can do what you tell it to.

And it usually some side effects - changes makes outside itself.

Output is printed, data is stored, a light turns on or a sound plays.

This gives a fast feedback loop.

Using code makes a sandcastle in the clouds, which otherwise never would have been and it can disappear if you wish. Or you can use it and share it.

You can build the sandcastle to change it. And you interact with the finished sandcastle - which is never really finished as it is not fixed.

Lyrics from the band aKING:

> A song is never finished, only abandoned.

Programming can be used to automate tasks, to process input and output, or to do your work. Or writing the code can be the work. Or it can be to make art, graphs, games or book. Or it can let you make things as a canvas, dashboard builder, game maker or content manager. It can make a game without a point or predictable score or outcome but that you can play with - a digital toy of sorts.
