## Learn

I love the W3 Schools site.

https://www.w3schools.com/

It covers:

- Tutorials
- Reference
- Examples
- Exercises

Mostly around HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but they also handle JS frameworks, Python, Java and more.

For the frontend side, the tutorials often have editable examples to demo HTML/JS/CSS behavior in your browser.


## Code challenges

You can find code challenges as algorithms to solve here - I liked [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) but there are plenty on the list.

## What to build

[Programming Ideas 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alansa.ideabag2&hl=en&gl=US) app on PlayStore. Regardless of your choice of scriping language, you can find something to test your skills in a language and build something useful from basic number calculator or todo app, to a factorial or Fibonacci calculator, to a high-performance multi-threaded application like a web server.

For more real-world applications, see [Most common applications to build with Ruby](https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/most-common-applications-ruby). If you build with JavaScript or Python, you'll find these are common projects to build too.
