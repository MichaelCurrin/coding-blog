I'd like to share some thoughts baesd, on advice I gave to some people new to coding.


## Goals

Keep your goals small and achievable at the start so you'll build confident, focus on a few well-defined problems and avoiding getting discouraged when you feel stuck or overwhelmed.


## Connect with people

Go to coding meetup events in your areas. AWS also has a few online sessions a month that you can join, covering both presentations and the chance to chat to others over a chatroom or video.

Share you learnings and what you've made with friends, colleagues and some public space (like GitHub or a blog). You'll be encouraged by positive reactions, you'll get feedback on how to add to your code or application in ways that you hadn't though of and you'll find out about bugs or friction that people experience installing or using your application. 


## Get help from the open source community

If you're lucky, you'll get contributions from the GitHub community such as issues or Pull Requests. Go to the Settings section of your repos. Disable this option: **Restrict editing to collaborators only**. Then when someone makes a fork of you're repo, they'll be allowed to submit a Pull Request. Also, this option allows anyone to add issues to site repo.

Be kind in your code reviews. Not everyone knows the language, tools and projects a well as you. They may have ideas or code styles which are different to yours. Seek to learn, understand and ask questions, before judging someone and their input or code.


## Contribute to the open source community

Find ways to contribute to Open Source projects - such as repos that you like or packages that you use. I would not recommend contributing to Open Source too early on, as even with experience I find it takes time to find projects and problems that matter to you and that match your skills. But when you do get to the point of getting your Pull Requests on repos merged, it is very satisfying. 

You'll also learn a lot about CI (automated tests and deploys), reviewing code and getting familar with another codebase. These skills are invaluable for working as a developer and getting practice on open source repos is a great way to hone these skills. Plus you're making the tech world a better place.
