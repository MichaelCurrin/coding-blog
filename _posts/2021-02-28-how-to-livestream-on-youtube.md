title: How to live-stream on YouTube
description: Stream your webcam or coding session to the world

I am only getting into live-streaming for the time but want to share the steps I learn as I go.

You can setup a live session on YouTube for free. There is just some verification to get through and some optional software depending on what you want to stream. I go through these here.

## Signup for live-streaming

1. Login to YouTube - [youtube.com](https://youtube.com/ "youtube.com").
2. Open YouTube Studio - [studio.youtube.com](https://studio.youtube.com/ "https://studio.youtube.com/").
3. Click _Create_ in the top right.
4. Click _Go live_.
5. You'll have to go through the _Verify_ flow. You'll be prompted for your country and phone number and will get a text message or call to verify that you are not a robot.
6. The dashboard will tell you to wait - _"Ready in 24 hours"_. Come back again and then click _Go live_.

## Setup screen-sharing

You can do this while you wait for the verification step.

If you just need to stream audio and video with your webcam, you'll probably be fine as you are.

To broadcast your screen, you'll need to install an encoder. As in my case, I want to stream a live coding session and don't care so much about the camera.

Go to the list of _YouTube Live verified encoders_ on this guide:

* [Create a livestream with an encoder](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en&ref_topic=9257984#zippy=%2Csoftware-encoders)

Find one appropriate for your device and operating system.

I like the idea of the first one on the list, as it works on macOS, Windows and Linux and is free and open source

* [Open Broadcaster Software®️](https://obsproject.com/ "Open Broadcaster Software®️")

When you launch the software, you'll have to give it permissions. I enabled use of mic. But denied use of keystrokes across applications (I prefer to be more cautious and secure and opt in only if I need this - maybe to display the keys on the screen as I press them).

You also need to login with your account credentials.

Select _YouTube - RTMP_.

Click _Get Stream Key_.

You'll get taken to the YouTube Studio dashboard. Get your key from there and paste it in the broadcaster app.

You can also click _Cancel_ if you want to look around the app without streaming yet.
