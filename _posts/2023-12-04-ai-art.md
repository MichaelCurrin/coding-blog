## Dall-E

- [dalle3.org](https://www.dalle3.org/)

Not recommended because of limited credits and much poorer quality than the next one below that uses the same model.


## Bing Image Creator

- [bing.com/images/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create)

Using Dall-E 3 too. This is the best beginner-friendly tool with low customization but impressive results. You can make an unlimited number of images. But after your quota after lightning/speed tokens is done for the day, your images are created much slower like every 30s or 5min, rather than within a 5 seconds.

Images are only 1024x1024 pixels, cannot be upsized, and you can't see your history of images beyond your recent ones (unless you know the URL).

On the homepage, you can see the popular creations by other users and use or tweak their prompts if you want, so that is great for learning.

## NightCafe

Gives more control like output size, number of images, model, and negative keywords. You can control whether your prompt is public or not. And you can upsize your image up to 8000x8000 pixels then download it, if you want to print or sell it, with no copyright restrictions.

You get to interact with other users, like on Instagram. You can reuse the prompts other users if they are open.

You get 5 points a day for logging in and 3 points if you share your creation with Instagram (with a link back to your creation). There is also an older SDXL model which costs zero credits if you want to experiment with that, until it gets depricated.

Here is my profile - [@MyKale](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/u/MyKale).


## Leonardo AI

- [leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai)

Originally for game development, this gives impressive quality and control. And you get enough free credits a day to create a couple of rounds of 4 images at a time. You can also use the prompts of other users if you like their images.

And you can do advanced features like background removal, upsizing and masking over select areas. There's also a neat tool for creating longer text prompts based on a short prompt, though a tool like ChatGPT is already capable of doing this well.


## Bing Chat

- [bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx)

This uses Bing Image Creator internally, but it is more interactive on the chat view or in the Edge sidebar. Also ChatGPT Plus just added image creation to text chat too, but that is only on the paid version.
