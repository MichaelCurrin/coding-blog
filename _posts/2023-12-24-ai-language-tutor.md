I have a passion for languages and am excited to learn Dutch (in the Netherlands) and bits of other languages I encounter. I found AI tools like ChatGPT can make the learning process faster and more fun. I decided to share my expertise here, so you can be equipped to do that too.


## Obstacles I encountered before AI

I use many approaches and tools at once to learn a language, but I find a lot of frustration still if I don't use AI.

- Sometimes Google Translate is too literal and lacks context and intent, and it can't explain why it used certain words or grammar.
- My friends and I found it hard to find content (like books and articles) that is appropriate for our language level and also interesting and relevant.
- When I read printed text, sometimes I wish I had the English version next to it.
- Some concepts in a language were hard for me to search with Google because I didn't know how to describe or label what I observed. Especially if it's slang, colloquial or informal. So I have to hope there's a good article or Quora thread out there about this topic.
- It is possible to use a Google search for a list of words or phrases to use for a restaurant or grocery store. But what about something more specific, like how to book a dentist appointment or talk about my specific hobbies and my home country?
- How do I know what to learn next?
- With structured tools like Duolingo, I found it takes a really long time to cover enough content to get the vocabulary for conversations that I have or expect to have soon, or I have to look through pages and pages piecing together what I need. Like talking to an acquaintance at a bar, asking for directions, interacting with a waiter, or at the market.
- A tool like Duolingo also feels very formal sometimes and it doesn't represent the kind of daily conversations you hear, like how people greet each other or say goodbye, or when express surprise or joy or annoyance when someone says something (e.g. "Wow, I can't believe that", "Did that really happen?", "Oh, how sweet", "Yuck, that's gross").
- I have many friends to a language with weekly. But I would like to have someone available 24/7 to engage with in a foreign language for as long as I want, explaining things to me and letting me choose text or audio options.


## Ways to use AI as a language tutor

Using AI, we can overcome the problems discussed above in a fast, easy, customized, and fun way.

Use your favorite AI chatbot for this. I found ChatGPT3, Bing, and Google Bard all handle foreign languages well. I have an article on tradeoffs between them and with links to each, if you like - [AI chatbot options in 2023](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/coding-blog/2023/10/28/ai-tools.html.)

### Have a conversation

You can think of the AI as a teacher helping you along or just a person you want to have a casual conversation with.

Ask it at the start to correct your grammar and spelling if you make mistakes. Give a topic or ask for topics. If you don't understand the language partner, ask for a translation of what was just said. Or ask for the target language and English in brackets for every message to you. Get it to focus on asking you questions.

### Roleplay

Ask to get the AI to get to know you, like a best friend, acquaintance, or date. Get it to ask you some icebreaker questions you'd find on the table at a speed dating event.

If you have something more technical like a job interview or questions to expect for a presentation, get the AI to take on one of these roles.

Get the AI to talk you through a situation you want to prepare for. e.g. Interactions with a waiter, booking a flight online, phoning to make a doctor's appointment, or giving directions to someone. If you are stuck for ideas, get the AI to come up with situations based on your intention for being in the country or speaking the language. Such as when you are abroad or a holiday, studying or relocating.

### Have a debate

Have a debate on a current topic. Such as the impact of social media, AI, animal testing, free education, or veganism. Ask the AI to generate some topics that are popular or even ones it can find in this month's news.

I got this idea from [TalkPal.ai](https://talkpal.ai), which has Debate as a premium feature.

### Do research

Are you interested in learning about the country you're in and how the culture? Ask the AI to give you some informative content and get it to

### Translation content you give it.

Ask for translations and explanations. Whether from your conversation or from text that you copy and paste. Give it an entire page if you want.

It will have a better understanding of the context and intent and multiple meanings of a word. Compared with Google Translate, which can be very literal and does not always capture the way a native would express themselves.

### Creative writing

Ask it to write a story at a level (e.g. absolute beginner, beginner, beginner-to-intermediate, or intermediate).

Pick a theme or genre that is interesting for you.  Ask it to write a story one paragraph or one chapter at a time, and on subsequent prompts say "next" or "more".

If the story gets boring you can ask for a plot twist or ask it to go in a certain direction.

Ask for explanations of words if you get stuck (it is also smart enough to explain the word in the context of the sentence).

### Generate words

Ask for a table or list of words in a setting or theme.

If the language you are learning has a gender, ask for that too.

> "Give me a list of fruit and vegetables as a table, with columns for Dutch and English. Include the gender e.g. (de) appel \| (the) apple".

### Generate phrases

Ask the AI for a table of phrases, with columns for English and your chosen language.

Do that for a particular situation like "talking about hobbies with a stranger" or "polite phrases at a restaurant to greet, order, and pay". You can give it more context first, like your personality and hobbies or favorite foods, then get it to start a conversation.

I am curious about learning a bit of a lot of languages. From my experience, I find this table-of-phrases approach way more effective and faster than using Duolingo (which is too slow and with a narrow structure) or finding an article online (which will have maybe 10 phrases and the next article will have mostly the same ones).

This approach is also great for learning informal aspects that might be in articles but not formal courses. Like slang, dialects, common informal expressions, and jokes.

### Translate across languages

You can ask for a table of multiple languages in one table e.g. English, Dutch, Spanish.

### Get phonetic pronunciation

You could ask for a column that is the phonetic pronunciation. Especially for languages like Japanese, Greek, or Polish with unfamiliar alphabets.

### Course outline

Generate a curriculum or practice exercises appropriate for your level.

This can be high-level initially. Then you can ask to start a section or move on to another. You could ask it to quiz you occasionally, or when it thinks the current section is complete.
