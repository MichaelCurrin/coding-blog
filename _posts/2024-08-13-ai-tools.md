I've spent a lot of time using and reading about AI tools this year and I'd like to share that knowledge with others. I've compiled a list of categories and tools within them, so you can choose the right tool for your situation and how get the most out of the tool. I've also added any limitations on functionality or free usage that you should know.

## Coding assistants

These tools streamline the coding process by offering code generation, auto-completion, and chat. All the tools in this section bring genAI to your IDE, so you don't have to switch to your browser and back.

Use these tools as assistants to automate tasks and augment your abilities, but remember to question and judge the quality of results instead of blindly accepting everything.

### Cursor

[cursor.so](https://www.cursor.so/)

Uses:
- Local IDE (based on VS Code) with code-generation functionality.
- Provides code generation in the terminal.

Offers a local IDE with code generation functionality, providing code creation and updates, auto-completion, and persistent chat history with the AI. I found this is more advanced than Codeium and GitHub Copilot.

Note that Cursor provides you with a limit of high-quality daily queries, then you are shifted down to the GPT-3.5 model for the free tier.

### Codeium

[codeium.com](https://www.codeium.com/)

Uses:
- Local IDE (based on VS Code) with code-generation functionality.
- Also available as a web-based IDE.

Similar to GitHub Copilot, except that Codeium offers an option for free usage, plus additional premium features.

Within the online environment, you can also run Python scripts in the terminal and so do queries for free against Gemini API. If you try that locally, you will get an error that access outside their environment is blocked, unless you add your payment details for Google Cloud.

### GitHub Copilot

[github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/)

Uses:
- Extension for VS Code with code-generation functionality.
- Available on the GitHub website as an AI assistant such as in Pull Requests.

Only available as a paid subscription.

### Amazon Q

[aws.amazon.com/q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/)

Uses:
- Chatbot 
- Extension for VS Code with code-generation functionality.
- Deploy AI-generated solutions.

I haven't use this one yet but it was recommended by a colleague. Amazon lists  5 products on their Amazon Q page, including:

- Amazon Q Business - Answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, etc. It can also generate and deploy apps based on the requirements you give it in natural language.
- Amazon Q Developer - chat, debug, add tests, upgrade.

See their [Getting Started](https://aws.amazon.com/q/getting-started/) page for how to use their options. 

The free tier is limited and then there is a paid tier. See the [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/) page.

## Webpage development

Tools to make webpages and preview them, without coding.

Note that these tools are powerful but if you do not specify exactly what you want, you may get unexpected results. And regardless of what you specify, there's a chance the results will not look good and they are sometimes not even interactive or visible.

### v0.dev

[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)

Uses:
- AI-powered code editor in the browser.
- Webpage preview.

You can enter a prompt and get results for webpages with previews, then tweak the results including targeting specific elements. It generates results with React and Tailwind which you can download.

It is convenient and powerful (including making animations and games). Thought it is  notas advanced as an IDE in terms of control and functionality and you start with an empty starting point rather than your codebase.

The v0.dev tool is also limited in that is only gives a single page.

You can achieve similar results if you use an IDE extension as a sidepanel or another window for your browser so you preview your app in realtime. Though, you'll have to interact with your code (possibly across several files) to get your code assistant to generate changes, while v0.dev allows you to right-click on an element on a page to edit it or add to it.

### Websim

[websim.io](https://websim.ai/)

Uses:
- Website creation.
- Image creation.

This is one of my favorite and most-used AI tools and it is entirely free.

## Chatbots

Tools that you can have a dialogue with in the browser.

### ChatGPT

[chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation (paid tier)
- API available
- Available in the browser, as a desktop app, and as a mobile app.

OpenAI's conversational AI model for natural language processing and dialogue.

The free tier is getting more powerful. After you have exceeded your allowance for a few hours, you need to use a less powerful model

### Gemini

[gemini.com](https://www.gemini.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Search your Google Drive, YouTube, and more with extensions.
- API available
- Available in the browser and as a mobile app.
- Can be used on Android as your Google Assistant.

The free tier works great and has a lot of functionality. Including uploading images and a button to read the text aloud.

### Bing Copilot 

[Bing Copilot](https://www.bing.com/chat)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Search assistant.

This tool is integrated into the Bing website and can be found on the Copilot tab, linked above. It is great for searching as it has access to the internet and can provide links as references.

Bing also offers a browser-based assistant, which can be found in sidepanel of Microsoft Edge. It has context about the page you're on so you can ask it questions or get it to summarize the page.

This is free and available as GPT-4 model. If you want more control such as keep your data private, then you can opt for the enterprise option.

### Claude

[anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- API available

Anthropic's AI assistant for natural language processing and dialogue, which can assist with webpage development.

With a feature added for artificats, it can generate multiple code files at once and preview them in the sidepanel, such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

The free tier is limited. After a couple of requests, you need to use a less powerful model

## Local AI

Tools to download and run LLM models locally, without an API key. Run either as a CLI tool or with a desktop user interface. There are plenty alternatives out there but I like these so far.

### LocalAI

[localai.io](https://localai.io/)

Uses:
- Chatbot.
- Local AI (CLI)
- Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API - wrap your mode in an API server.

This free, open-source alternative to OpenAI provides a drop-in REST API for local inferencing with LLMs, supporting image and audio generation on consumer hardware.

### LM Studio

[lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)

Uses:
- Chatbot.
- Local AI (desktop app)
- Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API - wrap your mode in an API server.

This user-friendly desktop app allows you to download and run models locally, offering a convenient way to experiment with LLMs.

### OllAMa

[ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)

Uses:
- Model hosting
- CLI-based local AI for running LLMs. Supports various model formats like HuggingFace, LLaMA, etc.

This free, open-source CLI tool supports various model formats and allows you to run LLMs locally. It provides access to a collection of models for download.

On their website, there are open-source AI models available to download for free.

### Fabric

[Fabric repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)

Uses:
- CLI-based tool for running LLMs.

This CLI-based tool allows you to run LLMs locally and can be configured with API keys to access external genAI APIs.

### Hugging Face

[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/)

Uses:
- Model hosting
- SaaS available on paid tier.

This platform offers a vast collection of AI models for download for free, which can be used with other local AI tools such as the ones listed above.

## Multiple models

Explore and compare different LLM and image models within your browser.

### Replicate 

[replicate.com](https://replicate.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation
- Web-based playground for the above
- API access available

This platform provides a browser-based playground for experimenting with various models, offering API access and documentation. Notably, check out the Flux models and Meta's 3.1 104b model:

- [replicate.com/black-forest-labs](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs)
- [meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct](https://replicate.com/meta/meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct)

The Replicate site is free to a point, but then you run out of credits and need to pay to access in the playground or API. Some models on the site have instructions for local development.

### Poe

[poe.com](https://poe.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation

On the Poe website, explore models by category and try them out. For example, you can use Claude, ChatGPT, Flux, and DallE-3.

The site is free but there are benefits for premium members.

## Image creation 

See a detailed comparision in my post, [AI art tools for 2023]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-12-04-ai-art.md %}).


## Music

### Udio
