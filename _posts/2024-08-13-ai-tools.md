## Coding assistants

You can code and learn with speed and accuracy if you use genAI as a just an assistant. Some tools allow generating code in the IDE, so you don't have to switch to your browser window and give it context and then bring the results back.

But, so don't expect a silver bullet to fix all your problems. Only about 20% of what an engineer does is actually coding and a lot of the genAI results are wrong or inaccurate and need understanding to know whether they are good or not. And real learning happens when you make mistakes and implement what you know, not just looking at what someone else has written for you (whether teacher, colleague, or AI).

### Cursor

[cursor.so](https://www.cursor.so/)

Uses:
- Local IDE (based on VS Code) with code-generation functionality.
- Provides code generation in the terminal.

This is more dynamic than the other tools I've used, with creating and updating code, auto-completion, and a sidebar of chats with the AI which do not disappear.

### Codeium

[codeium.com](https://www.codeium.com/)

Uses:
- Local IDE (based on VS Code) with code-generation functionality.
- Also available as Web-based IDE.

This is like GitHub Copilot but free, with limited usage but more on the premium tier

Within the online environment, you can also run Python code for free against Gemini API. This get blocked locally with an error, unless you add your payment details for Google Cloud.

### GitHub Copilot

[github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/)

Uses:
- Local IDE (based on VS Code) with code-generation functionality.
- Available on the GitHub website as an AI assistant such as in Pull Requests.

### Amazon Q

[aws.amazon.com/q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/)

Uses:
- Chatbot (answer questions, provide summaries, generate content)
- Coding assistant (code, test, upgrade)


## Webpage development

Tools to make webpages and preview them, without coding.

### v0.dev

[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)

Uses:
- AI-powered code editor in the browser.
- Webpage preview

Not as advanced as an IDE but you can enter a prompt and get results for webpages with previews, then tweak the results. It generates results with React and Tailwind which you can download.

### Websim

[websim.io](https://websim.ai/)

Uses:
- AI-powered website builder
- Website creation
- No-code development

It takes a prompt and generates a webpage using AI and the images are also AI-generated. Use it for fun or for quick building and prototyping. 

You can make a page, edit a page, or edit just element on the page - this makes it versatile for no-code development and protyping. The creations are also shareable and you can browse what other users are making.

It is the hallunicated form of the internet, so takes a while to get used to it. A webpage only exists when you navigate to it - so you can make an initial page with links that don't go anywhere get and the pages are generated on-the-fly.

You can download the results, which will be flat HTML, CSS, and JS. If you run it locally, you won't get an content generated dynamically by AI. But you can still use the downloaded code as a starting point, so you can connect to your own AI tools to make it dynamic. Or just use the page as a starting point for stlye and layout of your webpage or a component on a page.

## Chatbots

Tools that you can have a dialogue with in the browser.

### ChatGPT

[chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation (paid tier)

### Bing Copilot 

[Bing Copilot](https://www.bing.com/chat)

Available in the Copilot tab on the Bing website. It is great for searching as it has access to the internet and can provide links as references.

Also available as a browser assistant, it is sidepanel in Microsoft Edge so you can ask questions about a page.

This is free and available as GPT-4 model.

### Claude

[anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/)

Anthropic's AI assistant for natural language processing and dialogue, which can assist with webpage development.

With a feature added for artificats, it can generate multiple code files at once and preview them in the sidepanel, such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Local AI

Tools to download and run LLM models locally, without an API key. Run either as a CLI tool or with a desktop user interface. There are plenty alternatives out there but I like these so far.

### LocalAI

[localai.io](https://localai.io/)

Uses:
- Chatbot.
- Local AI (CLI)
- Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API - wrap your mode in an API server.

LocalAI is a free, open-source alternative to OpenAI, providing a drop-in REST API for local inferencing with LLMs, image and audio generation on consumer hardware without GPU, supporting multiple model architectures.

### LM Studio

[lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)

User interface for downloading and running models locally.

Uses:
- Chatbot.
- Local AI (desktop app)
- Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API - wrap your mode in an API server.

### OllAMa

[ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)

Uses:
- Model hosting
- CLI-based local AI for running LLMs. Supports various model formats like HuggingFace, LLaMA, etc.

OllAMa is a free, open-source CLI tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. It supports various model formats like HuggingFace and LLaMA, and provides a simple interface for interacting with LLMs without the need for complex setup or cloud services.

There are AI models available to download for free on the website.

### Fabric

[Fabric repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)

Uses:
- CLI-based tool for running LLMs.

Run against locally-running LLMs. It can be configured with API keys to run external genAI APIs.

### Hugging Face

[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/)

Uses:
- Model hosting
- SaaS available on paid tier.

Hugging Face provides AI models available to download for free on the website. There is no local tool available as far as I know, but the models can be used with the other local AI tools I covered above.

## Multiple models

Choose between LLM or image models in the browser.

### Replicate 

[replicate.com](https://replicate.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation
- Web-based playground for the above
- API access available

Pick models to run in the browser in their playground. For each model their are commands and documentation for how to access via API.

In particular, see the Flux models:

[replicate.com/black-forest-labs](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs)

And Meta's 3.1 104b model:

[meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct](https://replicate.com/meta/meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct)

Replicate is free to a point, but then you run out of credits and need to pay to access in the playground or API. Some tools have instructions for local development.

### Poe

[poe.com](https://poe.com/)

Uses:
- Chatbot
- Image creation

Alternative to chatGPT, for use in the browser. Compare various AI tools for free.


## Image creation 

See a detailed comparision in my post, [AI art tools for 2023]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-12-04-ai-art.md %}).


## Music

### Udio

[udio.com](https://www.udio.com/)

AI-generated music, starting with a short clip which you can extend into a full song.

See one of my [playlists](https://www.udio.com/playlists/bSgt3685wVm8n2w9mXNd6u).
