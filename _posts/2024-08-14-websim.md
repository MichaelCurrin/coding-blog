Websim is a no-code AI-powered website builder that allows you to generate webpages and AI-generated images based on natural language prompts. It offers a unique "hallucinated" internet experience, where pages are dynamically generated as you navigate, creating an initial page with links that don't lead anywhere until you visit them.

This tool is highly versatile for rapid prototyping, experimentation, and no-code development, enabling you to create, edit, or modify individual page elements with ease. This tool is particularly useful if you want to try out ideas for layout, color-schemes (dark or light or a specific color palette), or theme (such as MaterialUI). The generated websites are shareable, and you can browse creations by other users.

You can pick from some models for it use, like Claude and GPT-4.

## AJAX requests

The layout and style of the pages are not always consistent when loading a new page. So when I make an interactive tool, I rather load a part of the page with AI responses instead of loading the whole page. 

Specifically, ask it to query the "/api/generate" endpoint (using Websim's internal API) with an AJAX request and then use the response to update the content in-place. This usually gives great results, such as this page I made: [Language Assistant - Dutch Conversation Practice](https://websim.ai/@MichaelPythonDev/language-assistant-dutch-conversation-practice-pro).

## Images

One of Websim's strengths is hallunicating images using AI. It does this by creating an image element with alt text for the description, then generating and replacing the current element with the AI image. 

You can use this to generate a gallery of images that are mostly fixed but are slightly different on each page load. I made a gallery here: [
Amsterdam Houses Architecture Gallery](https://websim.ai/@MichaelPythonDev/amsterdam-houses-architecture-gallery).

Or you can make an interactive tool that makes images based on user input - here is an example I made that makes a fidget spinner: [Fidget Toy Builder](https://websim.ai/@MichaelPythonDev/fidget-toy-builder-create-your-custom-fidget-toy).

## Download Websim code

Regarding local use of the code, you can download your creation. Though your page will have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is static and not generated by the Websim site in realtime and any AJAX API requests will fail because it is from outside the website. 

But you that use your downloaded page as a starting point for further customization or integration with other AI tools. And if your page is entire static and not interactive (like an About page), then the AI part doesn't matter and you can keeping modifying and using the page locally.

You can download the code for your Websim.io creation, which will consist of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file. When running the file local, the dynamic AI-generated content and functionality provided by Websim.io will not be available. However, this static code can serve as a starting point for further customization and integration with other AI tools. If your webpage is entirely static and non-interactive, the absence of AI-generated content may not matter, so you can easily continue modifying and using the downloaded code locally.
