# My Projects

>_2018, Feb 22nd_

This article is around the projects I have hosted as [repositories on my Github profile](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories). I cover the reason I created them and some learnings and challenges I found while working on them. This article will continue to grow as work on these and other projects.


## [Developer Configurations](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/developer_configurations)

I like to customize the developer software I use. When I customize my work laptop, I want to have a reference online so I can easily apply the settings on my home laptop. And perhaps others can discover something they can apply.

## [Git Sandbox](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/git-sandbox)

This is a repo where I can mess around with commands in git especially around branches and rebasing and not worry about affecting anything.
