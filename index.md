## How I started coding

1. I did Java in high school then forgot most of it over the years.
1. I studied and started working in Marketing with a focus on digital marketing. So I got a good idea of advertising, social media, digital marketing, Google Anaytics and Google Adwords and building dashboards for analyizing brand performance.
1. While working in the field of marketing, I started learning Python for free on [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/).
1. I got bored with completing exercises. 
Then I found opportunities to automate parts of my jobs - pull social media and Google Ads data from APIs, building reports to aggregate data and sending out emails. So I went back to learn more Python using the course and other free online resources.
1. In 2017, I started my first tech job as Backend Developer.
- I have since picked up a lot of experience in work projects as a Fullstack Software Engineer. i.e. I work in the database, the server logic and running the HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the browser side.
I continue to keep my skills sharp with personal projects and community projects and learning new languages, libraries and concepts.
