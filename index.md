Welcome to my blog - I write about tech topics that interest me, my experience and learnings and advice to others.

My preferred tools are Python, JavaScript and Bash, so language-specific posts are about those often. I also like making static sites and learning to use CMS tools.

Follow me on my DEV.to blog. I post there regularly.
