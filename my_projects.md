This page highlights some my [Github repos](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories) which I would like to draw attention to. Either for other developers to use or learn from, or for anyone interest in using the service provided by the repo (in some cases, freely available and online).

I cover the reasons I created the repos and a summary of learnings and challenges I found while working on them.


## [Developer Configurations](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/developer_configurations)

I like to customize the developer software I use. When I customize my work laptop, I want to have a reference online so I can easily apply the settings on my home laptop. And perhaps others can discover something they can apply.

## [Git Sandbox](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/git-sandbox)

This is a repo where I can mess around with commands in git especially around branches and rebasing and not worry about affecting anything.
